### Iconfinder API node.js Example for JWT bearer grant flow

This folder contains example code that shows how to implement the server-side part of the JWT bearer flow in node.js.

To make the example usable you need to register your application at https://www.iconfinder.com/account/applications.

When your registration is complete, you will receive a `client_id` and a `client_secret` which you insert into the [code example](https://github.com/iconfinder/api-demo/blob/master/node-server/index.js).
